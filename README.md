`mpcv` is a TUI for [mpc](https://www.musicpd.org/clients/mpc/), because searching & playing a song is a tedious task for a CLI, and you probably don't want to install other clients like [ncmpcpp](https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp) because you already have `mpc` installed and that would be redundant.

You obviously require to have `mpc` installed
